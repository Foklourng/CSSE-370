Phase #1
  Test cases:
  1:A - Test two html files
  1:B - Assure there are at least one image is included in each file
  1:C - Check if the two files linked to each other
  1:D - Assure that there are at least three external links
  
  Note:
  I learned the foundation of HTML programming language and the basic structure of connecting two link together then commit it to GitHub.
  
  Phase #2
    Test cases:
    2:A - Check if the website contains 10 selectors (Tag name, Id, class, etc.)
    2:B - Add effects to the website: Sidebar, Display Focus, change on hover
    
  Note:
  There are many selectors that I can add into the project. I learned how sidebar works and some user intereaction
   
  Phase #3
     Test cases:
     3:A - Make the two html file work with mobile browser
     3:B - Check if the sidebar is pushed down when scale down
     3:C - Make sure the website contains no side scrolling
     
  Note:
  Making both html file to work on mobile platform is challenging and require a lot of testings. 
  
  Phase #4
      Test cases:
      4:A - check if the external JavaScript file is loaded by index.html
      4:B - Create new element when clicked on any other element
      4:C - Applying CSS to the element and delete it on click
      4:D - Check if the text element change when hover based on mouse location
      
  Note:
  I get some ideas of including JavaScript file and learned how to apply css to the element for more effects.
  
  Phase #5
      Test cases:
      5:A - Clear all the problems from both pages which defined by ANDI
      
  Note:
  My html files contain no problem at all.
  
  Phase #6
      Test cases:
      6:A - Check if the website pulled information from an API
      6:B - Print some choices based on the information from the API
      6:C - Request more information from the API based on user's input
      
  Note:
  Working with API is complicated since some APIs are unsecure and can be changed over times.
  
  Phase #7
      Test cases:
      7:A - Check if all risks are addressed in the API website through OWASP.
      
  Note:
  My API website does not contains any additional risks beside the server risk alerts. 
  
  Phase #8
      Test cases:
      8:A - Check if webpack is installed
      8:B - Check if the JavaScript file includes react component
      8:C - Implement the JavaScript with react component into the project
      8:D - Connect the react component to the project logically
  Note: 
  I learned how to implement react with my html file. I found react pretty useful in many situation even it requires a lot of programming knowledge.
